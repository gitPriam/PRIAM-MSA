# Work description

PRIAM-MSA is a microservices solution that supports the compliance of any software system. 
Below, we propose a prototype for integrating the right of access and the right of rectification. In particular, we'll see how the modification will be made at the `teaStore` database level. 
The **TeaStore**  is a micro-service reference and test application to be used in benchmarks and tests. It is used in the Cisco Full Stack Observability Workshop as demo application and has been referenced in numerous scientific publications.for more information see the [GitHub page](https://github.com/DescartesResearch/TeaStore) or [scientific publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/8526478/8526858/08526888.pdf?casa_token=me0s030sfHkAAAAA:q8Wpn-Vd4KksweFgvJcjGY57e7t1TMIgwtaqth8Uxcvb0YpZQRozGmhw3GmG0058Kqx5lOSka-A_)

- The file *``API dataAccessRight''* shows the example API endpoint for credential enforcement. it is given using the OpenAPI specification.

- The *``microservice''* folder includes all the microservices projects as well as the detailed README file, describing the essential steps to follow for the successful deployment of these microservices.

  ### To test the solution, you need 
    - IntelliJ IDEA.
    - MySQL DBMS.
